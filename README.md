We have created an online book store. First, I created the whole project in html style, and then I made all the changes in the CSS and added some animations.
Our project has 5 pages and an Admin panel
The first site I made with the help of css created a div with the mine class and inside I added another div with the head class and configured it using the grid.
and so set up all the pages. And added one page with animations with css.
